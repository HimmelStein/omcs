===================================

Where should you start?

* Try analyzing some text with :doc:`Luminoso <luminoso/index>`.
* Play with :doc:`Divisi <divisi2/index>` to see what's going on under
  the hood.
* Browse, query, and even add to :doc:`ConceptNet <conceptnet/index>`,
  the commonsense knowledgebase that powers it all.
