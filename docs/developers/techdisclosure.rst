SVDView Tech Disclosure Details
===============================

Advisor: Henry Lieberman

What does the invention do?
---------------------------
SVDview presents an interface for visualizing the results of dimensionality
reduction on a computer screen. These results might span a space of 20 or more
dimensions, so the interface gives the ability to intuitively rotate and zoom
the space to focus on particular clusters of results.

What advantages does it offer over the existing art?
----------------------------------------------------
SVD results are typically visualized by standard graphing tools, limiting
the results to those that can be visualized in two or three dimensions.
Other visualizers allow more dimensions to be visualized, but only through
unwieldy interfaces for rotating in the various dimensions.

An advantage of SVDview is its interface for rotation, in which one simply
clicks and drags on a result or cluster of results to indicate where it
should be projected, and the view performs whatever rotation is necessary
to accomplish this.

What parts of how it works does the inventor want to claim?
-----------------------------------------------------------
I don't know what this means.

Information about sponsors and licensing
----------------------------------------

BT has expressed interest in SVDview. In addition, SVDview would be useful to
any of our sponsors who are interested in analyzing their knowledge bases with
our technology, including Intuit, Microsoft, and Schlumberger.

SVDview itself is not at the center of these commercialization discussions;
it is simply a useful tool. For the same reason, it is unlikely that anyone
would found a company based on SVDview.

Our aim, as with other parts of our project, is to GPL the code but to offer
royalty-free non-exclusive licenses to interested sponsors, without the
restrictions of the GPL.

It is possible that SVDview would generate licensing revenue from non-sponsor
companies after the two-year embargo, if those companies are interested in
paying for a non-GPL license, but I find it unlikely that they would license
SVDview in isolation.
