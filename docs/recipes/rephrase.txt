In this recipe, we'll use ConceptNet's natural language tools (and basically
nothing else) to rephrase a sentence into various forms.

Load the English natural language tools, an instance of
:class:`csc.nl.NLTools` that you can get using :meth:`get_nl`.

>>> from csc.nl import get_nl
>>> en_nl = get_nl('en')

We're going to do everything using the :meth:`lemma_split` and
:meth:`lemma_combine` methods.

:meth:`lemma_split` will separate text into a *normalized form*, containing the
base forms of its content words, and a *residue*, describing the remaining text
that surrounds those content words. These two examples will illustrate:

>>> en_nl.lemma_split("you can sit on a couch")
(u'sit couch', u'you can 1 on a 2')

>>> en_nl.lemma_split("you are sitting on a couch")
(u'sit couch', u'you are 1ing on a 2')

Notice that in these two examples, the normalized forms are the same but the
residues are different.

Using :meth:`lemma_combine`, we can put these back together:

>>> en.nl.lemma_combine(u'sit couch', u'you are 1ing on a 2')
u'you are sitting on a couch'

By changing the residue while leaving the normalized form the same, we can
rephrase text.

>>> en.nl.lemma_combine(u'sit couch', u'1 on the 2')
u'sit on the couch'

>>> en.nl.lemma_combine(u'sit couch', u'a 2 is something for 1ing on')
u'a couch is something for sitting on'
